    Looks like you have found my website-- welcome! I am Parth, an undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk">Gonville and Caius College</a>, <a href="https://cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</a>. I am currently studying part II (third year) of the <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk">Mathematics Tripos</a>, and serve as the President of <a href="https://archim.org.uk">the Archimedeans</a> (Cambridge University Mathematics Society). You can read more about me <a href="./about.html">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    My mathematical interests range between functional analysis, algebraic geometry, and foundations. I document my thoughts and explorations in the form of articles <u><a href="./maths.html">here</a></u>, or as bite-sized gists <u><a href="./gists.html">here</a></u>. Hope something catches your interest!
